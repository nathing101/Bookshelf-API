# Bookshelf-API

As a beginner backend who is completing the final project in the "Learn to Build Back-End Applications for Beginners" course titled "Submission Bookshelf API", your responsibility is to design, develop, and test an API that has the ability to store, display all books, display book details, change book data, and delete books. Make sure the implementation follows the basic back-end programming concepts taught in the course and is complete with documentation so that it can be tested and evaluated effectively.
